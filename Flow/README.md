Flow was built using:

1. [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) - a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences
2. [p5.sound.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound) - p5.sound brings the Processing approach to Web Audio and p5.js
3. [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) - a lightweight controller library for JavaScript

> Flow was built as a part of ICM class @ ITP, NYU lectured by Daniel Shiffman.
